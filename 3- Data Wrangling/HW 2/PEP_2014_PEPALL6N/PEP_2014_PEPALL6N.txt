Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Single Year of Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014

Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010
population due to the Count Question Resolution program. Median age is calculated based on
single year of age. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race.  Hispanics may be
of any race. Responses of "Some Other Race" from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in
differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census
population in this table versus those in the original 2010 Census data. For more information,
